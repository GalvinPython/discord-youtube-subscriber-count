# Self-hostable YouTube Sub Notifier Bot
(This is my first time setting up an opensource repository so that other could read the code so im so sorry for the mess i have done lol)

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.27. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
