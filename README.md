`events` has Discord.JS events like interactionCreate (for each application command event type (chatInput, ...etc)) and clientReady here.

`commands` is a categorized folder full off commands like **ping** _(utilities.ts)_ that the bot will read when its initializing.

`types` is types for things that needs types. Right now when I'm writing this there is only **commands.d.ts** which is just types for the **commands** folder and the commands inside it so that the _command_

`innertube` has functions for getting data from youtube without an api key.

btw, this project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.29. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.


(This is my first time setting up an opensource repository so that other could read the code so im so sorry for the mess i have done lol)
